This is the final project for the Statistical Inference course at Politecnico di Milano focuses on forecasting the number of goals a team scores during a season using a linear model, as well as performing an ANOVA analysis of the average goals scored in the top 5 European leagues. The model's features were selected based on the AIC criterion, considering the most relevant variables, such as: ball possession, shots, aerials won, and yellow and red cards.
